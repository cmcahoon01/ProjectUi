# Hand Writing Estimator

## By Connor Cahoon

The purpose of this project is to create a program capable of receiving a drawn letter or symbol, 
and making a guess as to what was drawn.

My milestones for each phase are as follows:
 - **Phase 1**: Set up project structure and establish command line interface in place of gui. This should follow the same
 control flow as the final project.
 - **Phase 2**: Create basic estimation algorithm, using sudo inputs. Save and load previous knowledge to and from memory.
 - **Phase 3**: Implement gui capable of user drawings that can be fed to estimator. Display estimation.
 - **Phase 4**: Finalize estimation algorithm. Do tests and find any bugs, increase quality of life.
 
 ## User Stories
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Users must be able to add a letter to the collection of possible letters. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Users must be able to select a symbol to add references to. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Users must be able to add many new drawings to an existing symbol. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Users must be able to ask the program to begin guessing symbols. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Users must be able to draw as many symbols as they like for the program to guess. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Users must be able to save the estimator and symbols for later use. <br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; Users must be able to load previous estimators symbols. <br>
